## Application Run Through

Used Express with Axios to parse through the information from the JSON data from LCBO for the backend.
Using ReactJS to display the data to the client and displaying the requirement from the challenge.

## Application Design and Thought

Design the application using the MERN stack approach, using my ExpressJS with the LBCO api key and cors.
Created the API link calls and validated the backend testing by trying the product/beer ids provide in the JSON data.

As for frontend, used ReactJS and axios to get the data from the API then map into the arrays to store the single
data to display the single beer item or to display a list of beer items.

## Installation on Client and Server

Need to install on client side and server side:

* `install-client` is to install the node packages for clients.
* `install-server` is to install the node packages for server.

## Running both Client and Server

Need to run the app for client side and server side:

* `dev` is to install the node packages for clients.
