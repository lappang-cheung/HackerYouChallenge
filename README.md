## Application run through

Used Express with Axios to parse through the information from the JSON data from LCBO for the backend.
Using ReactJS to display the data to the client and displaying the requirement from the challenge.


## Installation on Client and Server

Need to install on client side and server side:

* `install-client` is to install the node packages for clients.
* `install-server` is to install the node packages for server.

## Running both Client and Server

Need to run the app for client side and server side:

* `dev` is to install the node packages for clients.
